# CVPR-2020
Valuable notes and toy projects from CVPR 2020 Tutorial on Image Retrieval in the Wild

this is a summary of [CVPR 2020 Tutorial on Image Retrieval](https://matsui528.github.io/cvpr2020_tutorial_retrieval/) in the Wild, I have found Matsui Sensei's talk on Billion scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search extremely informative, therefore I tried to summarize  the key points in here for my own reference.

## Research Question: Given a query ùíí, find the closest vector from the database(One of the fundamental problems in computer science)

## Solution: 
1. Nearest Neighbor Search(NN) :worried:

    linear scan, ùëÇ(ùëÅùê∑), slow 

2. Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search(ANN) :blush:

    Faster search
    Don‚Äôt necessarily have to be exact neighbors
    Trade off: runtime, accuracy, and memory consumption

## Solution Implementation 
### NN
Na√Øve implementation

Fast implementation (by Faiss) : Matrix multiplication by BLAS

ps : NN in GPU (faiss gpu ) is 10x faster than NN in CPU faiss cpu

### ANN

#### Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)


* Math friendly :blush:

* Popular in the theory area (FOCS, STOC, ‚Ä¶) :blush:

* Large memory cost :worried:

* Need several tables to boost the accuracy :worried:

* Need to store the original data on memory :worried:

* Data dependent methods such as PQ are better for real world data :worried:

* Thus, in recent CV papers, LSH has been treated as a classic method :worried: :worried:

Implementation by Flconn

#### Tree/ Space Partitioning

#### Graph traversal

* Very popular in recent years
* Around 2017, it turned out that the graph traversal based methods work well for million scale data
* Pioneer:
    * Navigable Small World Graphs (NSW)
    * Hierarchical NSW (HNSW)
* Implementation: nmslib , hnsw , faiss
