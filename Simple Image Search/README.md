## Usage
```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Put your image files (*.jpg) on static/img

# Then fc6 features are extracted and saved on static/feature
# Note that it takes time for the first time because Keras downloads the VGG weights.
python offline.py

# Now you can do the search via localhost:5000
python server.py
```
